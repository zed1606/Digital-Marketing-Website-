# Digital-Marketing-Website-
**Task:** Create a modern, high-performance website for a digital marketing agency with a bold and dynamic design.  

#### **Design & Branding Requirements:**  
- **Color Scheme:** Primarily use **black (#000000), white (#FFFFFF), green (#00FF00 or similar vibrant shade), and red (#FF0000 or similar bold shade)**.  
- **Typography:** Clean, modern fonts (e.g., **Montserrat, Poppins, or Inter**) with bold headings for impact.  
- **Animations:**  
  - Smooth hover effects on buttons and cards.  
  - Subtle **GSAP/ScrollTrigger** animations for scrolling (e.g., fade-ins, parallax).  
  - Dynamic background elements (e.g., floating particles, gradient shifts).  
- **Mobile-First Approach:** Fully responsive, with priority on mobile UX (touch-friendly, fast load times).  

#### **Sections to Include:**  
1. **Hero Section**  
   - Bold headline (e.g., *"Elevate Your Brand with Data-Driven Marketing"*)  
   - Animated CTA button (e.g., *"Get a Free Audit"*)  
   - Background: Abstract digital-themed animation (e.g., moving grids, binary code effects).  

2. **Services**  
   - Cards with hover animations (SEO, PPC, Social Media, Content Marketing).  
   - Icons or mini-animations when hovering.  

3. **Portfolio/Case Studies**  
   - Interactive slider/grid with before/after results.  

4. **Testimonials**  
   - Auto-scrolling carousel with fade effects.  

5. **CTA Section**  
   - Red or green accent button with a micro-interaction (e.g., pulse effect).  

6. **Footer**  
   - Clean layout with social media links (hover color transitions).  

#### **Technical Requirements:**  
- **Framework:** Next.js (for performance) or a no-code tool like Webflow/Framer (if AI supports it).  
- **Animations:** GSAP, Tailwind CSS, or CSS keyframes.  
- **Responsiveness:** Flexbox/Grid, with breakpoints for all devices.  
- **Performance:** Optimized images, lazy loading.  

#### **Tone & Messaging:**  
- **Professional yet edgy** (e.g., *"We Don’t Just Grow Traffic—We Dominate Markets"*).  
- Benefit-driven copy highlighting ROI, speed, and innovation.

### **Additional Notes:**  
- Use **dark mode as default** (black background, white text) with green/red accents.  
- Ensure all animations are **smooth but not distracting** (60fps+).  
- Include a **contact form** with validation and success animation.
